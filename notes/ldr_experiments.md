# LDR Experiments

## Observations
- Circuit works even without diode and gate capacitor.
- MOSFET gets hot if wrong connections are made.
- Tiny MOSFETs are hard to solder â†’ lost 3 pieces ðŸ˜…

## Next Steps
- Add flyback diode to protect MOSFET.
- Try bigger MOSFETs for easy soldering.
- Test different resistor values with LDR.
